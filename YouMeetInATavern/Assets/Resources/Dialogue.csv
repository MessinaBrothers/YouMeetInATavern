NPC_BARTENDER,0,,"<>Gonna have to speak up, darling. It’s quite loud in here.<>"
NPC_BARTENDER,0,intro,<>Nice to meet you! Sit anywhere you like. It’s pretty slow right now.
NPC_BARTENDER,0,default,<>We have wheat ale for two copper. Interested?
NPC_BARTENDER,1,default,<RUMOR>Heard any rumors lately?
NPC_BARTENDER,0,RUMOR,<>Hmm...let’s see. A merchant was robbed a couple of days ago just outside of town. They say it was bandits.
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_KOBOLDS_CORRECT,<>Well done on the Kobold situation! Your next order is on the house!
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_KOBOLDS_MISSING,"<>Those Kobolds were tough. Most of them made it out, but they’ll probably be back. And soon."
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_KOBOLDS_BARTENDER,<>Sorry about last night. I’m no good at that kind of stuff!
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_KOBOLDS_WRONG,"<>Did you hear? Kobolds came into town and robbed us blind! They’re gonna be back for more, I just know it."

NPC_RANGER,1,MONSTER,<KOBOLDS>What do you know about tiny green creatures?

NPC_SCOUT,0,default,<>Who do you want killed?
NPC_SCOUT,1,KOBOLDS,<TRAPS>What can you tell me about kobold traps?
