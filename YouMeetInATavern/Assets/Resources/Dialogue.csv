NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_0,"Nice to see you! I’m the <NPC_BARTENDER>barkeep.<> If you want some <ITEM_ALE>ale,<> just ask. Or did you want to hear some <LOCATION_TOWN_GENERICROBBED>local gossip?"
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_1,"Nice to see you! I’m the <NPC_BARTENDER>barkeep.<> If you want some <ITEM_ALE>ale,<> just ask. Or did you want to hear some <LOCATION_FOREST_GENERICLIGHTS>local gossip?"
NPC_BARTENDER,0,NPC_BARTENDER,"<>Me? Go out there? Well, I could step out after we close...Okay, let’s do it!"
NPC_BARTENDER,0,ITEM_ALE,"<>On ale, coming right up! We keep the barrels in the cellar, so it’s nice and cool."
NPC_BARTENDER,0,LOCATION_TOWN_GENERICROBBED,"<>More and more peoples’ houses in town are being robbed in the night. If the Watch doesn’t figure out who it is, there’s gonna be riots in the streets."

NPC_BARTENDER,0,DIALOGUE_TOWNKOBOLDS,"<>Kobolds? Is that some sort of mixed drink? We only serve <ITEM_ALE>ale <>here, sorry."
NPC_BARTENDER,0,LOCATION_FOREST_GENERICLIGHTS,<>People have seen strange lights in the forest at night. And lately I’ve seen a lot of undesirables in town. Don’t know if it’s related or what.
NPC_BARTENDER,0,RESULT_0_CORRECT,"<>Heard you put a stop to the burglaries! Kobolds, huh? Don’t know much about those...Anyways, your next order is on the house!"
NPC_BARTENDER,0,RESULT_0_MISSING,<>Heard you went out and tried to stop those robbers. The Town Watch is useless!
NPC_BARTENDER,0,RESULT_0_BARTENDER,<>Sorry about last night. I’m no good at that kind of stuff! You should talk to the Town Watch if you want real help.
NPC_BARTENDER,0,RESULT_0_WRONG,<>Did you hear? Burglars struck the town again! That Town Watch is less than useless!
NPC_BARTENDER,0,RESULT_1_WRONG,<>Some townsfolk went missing during the night! What’s going on?!
NPC_MERCHANT,0,,<>I don’t understand you.
NPC_MERCHANT,0,intro,<>The tavern has about as many customers as I had all day – not many! Where’s everyone gone?
NPC_MERCHANT,0,default,ERROR: NO DIALOGUE FOR THIS SCENARIO
NPC_MERCHANT,0,SCENARIO_0,"<>Just a <NPC_MERCHANT>local merchant <>enjoying a drink. I run a stall in the <LOCATION_TOWN_GENERIC>market <>outside. If you got something to sell, come to me first. If you got something to buy, even better. We could even work out a <ITEM_GOLD>loan, <>if you’re short on funds."
NPC_MERCHANT,0,NPC_MERCHANT,"<>If you know of buyers, I’ll follow you to the ends of the earth. Just let me gather my wares first."
NPC_MERCHANT,0,ITEM_GOLD,"<>Ah, want to borrow some coin? Not a problem. I have some gold to lend right here. You know, for short-term emergencies such as these."
NPC_MERCHANT,0,LOCATION_TOWN_GENERIC,"<>Not much going on, I’m afraid. The market’s been pretty quiet these last couple of days, unfortunately."

NPC_RANGER,0,LOCATION_FOREST_GENERIC,<>Didn’t see anything unusual in the forest today.
NPC_RANGER,1,MONSTER,<KOBOLDS>What do you know about tiny green creatures?
NPC_RANGER,0,KOBOLDS,<>You mean kobolds? Pests! You never see them coming. They love to lay traps. And they love gold even more.
NPC_RANGER,0,NPC_RANGER,"<>Sure, I’ll follow you. Is it okay if I bring my giant panther?"
NPC_RANGER,0,ITEM_BOW,"<>You can’t have my bow, but I’ve got a spare for you."
NPC_THIEF,0,,<>Come again?
NPC_THIEF,0,intro,<>Don’t mind me. Just looking for a corner to settle into. Why are you giving me the side-eye? I haven’t even done anything!
NPC_THIEF,0,default,ERROR: NO DIALOGUE FOR THIS SCENARIO
NPC_THIEF,0,SCENARIO_0,<>Lost something? I’m the best<NPC_THIEF>...finder. <>For a price. No one in <LOCATION_TOWN_GENERIC>town <>can stop me when I have my <ITEM_THIEVESKIT>thieves’ kit. <>I mean my thieves’ tools. I mean my tools!
NPC_THIEF,0,NPC_THIEF,"<>Sure, I can...retrieve...something for you. We shouldn’t talk about it here. Find me in the alley out back."
NPC_THIEF,0,ITEM_THIEVESKIT,"<>Sure, you can have a kit. I got a spare to sell right here, dirt cheap."
NPC_THIEF,0,LOCATION_TOWN_GENERIC,"<>Why’s everyone asking me about robberies? You don’t rob your neighbors! That’s just asking for trouble. I only rob outside of tow...I mean, I would if I was in that sort of work. Hypothetically."

NPC_TOWNWATCH,0,intro,<>Can’t wait to put my boots up. It’s been a rough couple of weeks.
NPC_TOWNWATCH,0,default,<>I’m between shifts as <NPC_TOWNWATCH>town watch. <>It’s tough work patrolling the entire <LOCATION_TOWN_GENERIC>town <>when all they issue us is a lousy <ITEM_TORCH>torch.
NPC_TOWNWATCH,0,SCENARIO_0,<>I’m between shifts as <NPC_TOWNWATCH>town watch. <>It’s tough work patrolling the entire <LOCATION_GREENTRAPS>town <>when all they issue us is a lousy <ITEM_TORCH>torch.
NPC_TOWNWATCH,0,LOCATION_TOWN_GENERIC,<>Town was quiet last night. I stayed in and got a chance to play some cards with the boys.
NPC_TOWNWATCH,0,NPC_TOWNWATCH,"<>Meet me at the keep. I can deputize you, but we’ll have to stick together. It’s dangerous out there."
NPC_TOWNWATCH,0,ITEM_TORCH,<>You want this torch? Take it. I’ll just grab another from the armory when my break is over. It’s all they ever have!
NPC_TOWNWATCH,1,LOCATION_TOWN_GENERICROBBED,<LOCATION_GREENTRAPS>Robberies in town?
NPC_TOWNWATCH,0,LOCATION_GREENTRAPS,<>The whole town’s up in arms about some robber. Thing is...it’s not just one robber - It’s a whole gang of green guys! We don’t know WHAT they are. They only enter town at night. Don’t believe me? <NPC_TOWNWATCH>Join me in a patrol and I’ll lead you right to ‘em. <>We just can’t catch the little guys due to all the traps they lay out for us.
NPC_TOWNWATCH,1,DIALOGUE_TOWNKOBOLDS,<DIALOGUE_TOWNKOBOLDS>They’re kobolds!
NPC_TOWNWATCH,0,DIALOGUE_TOWNKOBOLDS,"<>Well, whatever they are, they’re tricky little things. Our <ITEM_TORCH>torches <>are useless against them! We need <NPC_TOWNWATCH>assistance."

NPC_LOREMASTER,0,ITEM_GLASSES,"<>Oh wait, these are my old pair. Where are my new ones...here they are! What’s that? You want the old ones? Here you are."
NPC_LOREMASTER,0,LOCATION_TOWN_GENERIC,"<>Not much of a gossip, sorry. My nose has been buried in my books. Wait, where’d my <ITEM_GLASSES>glasses <>go?"
NPC_LOREMASTER,1,LOCATION_TOWN_GENERICROBBED,<LOCATION_TOWN_GENERICROBBED>Robberies in town?
NPC_LOREMASTER,0,LOCATION_TOWN_GENERICROBBED,"<>People can’t stop talking about robberies or some such nonsense. That’s all they ever want do – talk! None of my books have been taken, that’s all I know."
NPC_LOREMASTER,1,LOCATION_GREENTRAPS,"<DIALOGUE_TOWNKOBOLDS>What’s small, green, and lays traps?"
NPC_LOREMASTER,0,DIALOGUE_TOWNKOBOLDS,"<>Green people? Small? With traps? Hmm...sounds like Kobolds! All they care about is gold. Gold coins, gold silverware, gold jewelry, anything they can get their tiny little hands on. Be careful trying to catch one: their traps can be quite painful. Or so I’ve read."
