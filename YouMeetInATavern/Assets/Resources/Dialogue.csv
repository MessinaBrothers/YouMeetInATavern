NPC_BARTENDER,0,,"<>Gonna have to speak up, darling. It’s quite loud in here.<>"
NPC_BARTENDER,0,intro,<>Nice to meet you! Sit anywhere you like. It’s pretty slow right now.
NPC_BARTENDER,0,default,<NPC_BARTENDER>Wish I could see the world like you. <>Anyway...we have <ITEM_ALE>wheat ale for two copper. <>Interested?
NPC_BARTENDER,1,default,<RUMOR>Heard any rumors lately?
NPC_BARTENDER,0,RUMOR,<>Hmm...let’s see. A merchant was robbed a couple of days ago just outside of town. They say it was bandits.
NPC_BARTENDER,0,NPC_BARTENDER,"<>Me? Go out there? Well, I could step out after we close...Okay, let’s do it!"
NPC_BARTENDER,0,ITEM_ALE,"<>We keep the barrels in the cellar, so it’s nice and cool."
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_KOBOLDS_CORRECT,<>Well done on the Kobold situation! Your next order is on the house!
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_KOBOLDS_MISSING,"<>Those Kobolds were tough. Most of them made it out, but they’ll probably be back. And soon."
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_KOBOLDS_BARTENDER,<>Sorry about last night. I’m no good at that kind of stuff!
NPC_BARTENDER,0,SCENARIO_KOBOLDS_WRONG,"<>Did you hear? Kobolds came into town and robbed us blind! They’re gonna be back for more, I just know it."
NPC_MERCHANT,0,,<>I don’t understand you.
NPC_MERCHANT,0,intro,<>I have traveled for a long while. It’s high time I enjoy some entertainment.
NPC_MERCHANT,0,default,"<>Need something? <NPC_MERCHANT>Everything’s for sale, for the right <ITEM_GOLD>coin."
NPC_MERCHANT,1,RUMOR,<MONSTER>You were robbed?
NPC_MERCHANT,0,MONSTER,"<>Robbed? No, we were attacked! By tiny green creatures, no less. They killed half my guards before taking off with my stock."
NPC_MERCHANT,0,ITEM_GOLD,"<>You can’t just have my gold! I can offer you a loan, however."
NPC_MERCHANT,0,NPC_MERCHANT,"<>You know a potential customer? Not in the tavern, you say? Only you know where they are? Lead the way!"
NPC_RANGER,0,,<>Huh?
NPC_RANGER,0,intro,<>I parked my giant panther out front.
NPC_RANGER,0,default,<>The woods are quiet tonight. <NPC_RANGER>Not much ranging to do. <ITEM_BOW>My arrows are staying in my quiver.
NPC_RANGER,1,MONSTER,<KOBOLDS>What do you know about tiny green creatures?
NPC_RANGER,0,KOBOLDS,<>You mean kobolds? Pests! You never see them coming. They love to lay traps. And they love gold even more.
NPC_RANGER,0,NPC_RANGER,"<>Sure, I’ll follow you. Is it okay if I bring my giant panther?"
NPC_RANGER,0,ITEM_BOW,"<>You can’t have my bow, but I’ve got a spare for you."
NPC_SCOUT,0,,<>Come again?
NPC_SCOUT,0,intro,<>The pleasure is mine.
NPC_SCOUT,0,default,<>Who do you want <NPC_SCOUT>killed?
NPC_SCOUT,1,KOBOLDS,<TRAPS>What can you tell me about kobold traps?
NPC_SCOUT,0,TRAPS,<>Pretty basic stuff. Any <ITEM_THIEFSKIT>thief’s kit<>would make short work of ‘em.
NPC_SCOUT,0,ITEM_THIEFSKIT,"<>I got an extra one, if you need it. Just let me know."
NPC_SCOUT,0,NPC_SCOUT,"<>Yes, I kill people. We shouldn’t talk about it here. Find me in the alley later."

NPC_GUARD,0,TOWN_QUIET,Nothing! The whole town was quiet today. I hated it!
NPC_GUARD,0,GUARD_HISTORY,<>Not much action in town. It’s nothing like it was in <GUARD_SOLDIER>my soldier days. <ITEM_SWORD>Percy’s staying in her hilt.
NPC_GUARD,0,GUARD_SOLDIER,"<>Aye, I was quite the fighter, too. But now my knee isn’t what it used to be."
NPC_GUARD,1,GUARD_SOLDIER,<NPC_GUARD>Can you still fight?
NPC_GUARD,0,NPC_GUARD,"<>I can still swing a sword, if that’s what you’re asking. If you need help, just say the word."
